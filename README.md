# SST Operational Efficiency Application - DDCo-Lab Project

## Project Description
This repository hosts the SST Operational Efficiency Application, developed as a part of the DDCo-Lab course in collaboration with the HVV (Hamburg Public Transport Company). This web application is designed to optimize the management of Self-Service Terminals (SSTs) within public transport systems. It provides real-time data visualization and operational insights to improve maintenance efficiency and response times.

## Key Features
- Interactive map showcasing real-time SST statuses.
- Prioritization of issues based on severity for efficient maintenance response.
- Data-driven approach for operational management and planning.
- Future potential for route planning for service personnel and verification for ticket control.

## Academic Context
